Initial Condition Generator for Hydro

- splitandfit .cpp and .h: Domain Splitting Algorithm implementation based on near equal integration value 
                           of each subdomain for the provided density function. Alternative algorithms will be Implemented in the future.

- trial-functions .cpp .h: Catalogue of Density and Velocity Functions to be fed to the splitandfit library. 
    Already Implemented:
      Density Profiles:
        -- Gaussian with Hotspot (winicon)
        -- Woodsaxon 
        -- Woodsaxon with Hotspot
        -- Gubser Entropy 
      Velocity Profiles:
        -- Null 
        -- Gubser 

- domain-spliting .ccp: Program that uses the splitandfit library

- sph-dens .cpp: Ploting Program, to check quality of fit from splitandfit library

- example .cpp: Example program of how to use the splitandfit library, 
                tutorial of how to use the progam included on the comments

- gaus2d.cpp: simple smooth profile

- drawIniConProfile: draw 2D plot of the initial
  condition profile (needs ROOT libraries)

Obs:

- In case makefile don't work, try creating a obj folder on the home directory. It's necessary to store the .o files temporarely
